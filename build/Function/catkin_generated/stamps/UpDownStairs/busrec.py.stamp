Its core function is to provide clear, audible information about bus numbers, focusing on a specific set: 466, 601, 400内, and 400快内. This targeted approach ensures that the information is highly relevant and concise, making it easily comprehensible for users. BusRec is programmed to recognize these bus numbers and announce them as they arrive, avoiding any details about bus routes, schedules, or other transportation information, to maintain simplicity and directness in its assistance."
